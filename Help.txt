Here's a feedback structure for a Scrum Master to provide excellent feedback on both "continue doing" and "have more impact":

**Subject:** Feedback on Your Work and Impact

Hi [Colleague's Name],

I wanted to take a moment to provide feedback on your recent contributions to the team. Your work has been truly valuable, and I’d like to highlight a few areas where you're excelling and areas where you can have an even greater impact.

### Continue Doing:
- **Collaboration and Team Spirit:** Your willingness to support others and collaborate effectively is a real asset to the team. Keep up the great teamwork.
- **Proactiveness in Problem Solving:** You have a great ability to identify potential issues early and bring them to the team’s attention. This helps us stay on track during sprints.
- **Attention to Detail:** The precision with which you handle tasks ensures high-quality work. Your thoroughness really shows in the final product.

### Have More Impact:
- **Take Initiative in Leading Discussions:** You’ve been doing great in contributing ideas. By stepping up to lead more discussions during retrospectives or sprint planning, you can further shape the team’s direction.
- **Drive Cross-Team Collaboration:** You already communicate well within our team. Expanding your collaboration to other teams or stakeholders could create more alignment and drive broader success.
- **Share Your Expertise:** You have strong technical and process knowledge. Sharing more of that expertise in mentoring or coaching less experienced team members will amplify your influence across the team.

Overall, your work has been excellent, and I believe with these adjustments, you’ll have an even greater impact on the team’s success.

Best regards,  
[Your Name]
